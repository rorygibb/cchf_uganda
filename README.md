# Understanding the epidemiology and ecology of CCHF in Uganda

Repository contains scripts, data and key outputs from Uganda/Africa-wide CCHF risk modelling analysis. 

Scripts to run all models and produce figures:
↳ scripts 

Datasets used in the analysis:
↳ data → cchf_brt [CCHF occurrence data and spatial predictors for exposure model]
↳ data → chelsa_climatologies [Africa bioclimatic variables from CHELSA]
↳ data → host_occurrences [Geolocated mammal host occurrences]
↳ data → ndvi_copernicus [Africa long-term NDVI variables]
↳ data → project_shapefiles [Africa and Uganda shapefiles]
↳ data → tick_occurrences [Geolocated tick occurrences]

Summary modelling outputs:
↳ output → cchf_exposure_map [mean and SD of BRT ensemble prediction of CCHF exposure risk]  
↳ output → tick_host_suitability [Uganda-specific and Africa-wide ensemble mean predictions of tick/mammal suitability]
